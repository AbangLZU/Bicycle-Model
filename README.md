# Bicycle-Model
Development of a kinematic simulator of the famous bicycle model sometimes called wrongly as the Ackemann Model.
Widely used in robotics for simullations, tracking and path planning.

This repo was develop during a small reseach about indoor robot localizaton using Kalman filters for non-linear systems. The reseach result in some papers publications and a honor medal in the Unesp congress.

The link below shows the documentation of the simulator developed.
