Welcome to 2D Robot Simulator - DEE UNESP's documentation!
==========================================================
This project is a toolbox for basic 2-Dimension robot simulator. It was develop
by students of the Department of Electrical Engineering of UNESP Bauru with the
objective of simulate a car-like vehicle running through a planar environment.

The initial uses of the simulator was in studies about localization, mapping and
control of mobile robots. But it can be easily upgraded to new uses, such as marine
vehicles and industrial manipulators.

**We hope you enjoy it and lets make robots!**
